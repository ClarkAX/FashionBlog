        if you've never been. Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide

        If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag.
        But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to
        help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you
        and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET.
        If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won't
        have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the
        designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get
        excited!

        Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll
        be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is
        about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have
        chosen to express through their new lines. Also it's important to
        wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to
        look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.
